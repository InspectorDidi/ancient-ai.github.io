								<p>Welcome.</p>
								<p>Did you think that rats do not have hearts? Wrong. All living things have a heart. And the heart of any living thing can be broken. Reader, do you think it is a terrible thing to hope when there is really no reason to hope at all? Or is it (as the soldier said about happiness) something that you might just as well do, since, in the end, it really makes no difference to anyone but you?</p>

								<h2 class="major">Experience</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Object Oriented Programming, Database Management, IT Ethics, Cyber Awareness, Amateur Pen-Testing, Web Development, and Computer Hardware Maintenance</p>
								<p>I have worked part-time for the University of Nebraska - Lincoln's Police Department as an IT Assistant for over two years. My job has consisted of supporting Windows 7 and Windows 10 applications and software, understanding how Active Directory is managed in a near-constant uptime environment, fixing DNS and VPN settings during football games, and being a generally well-rounded source of support for all the employees of the UNLPD.</p>
								<p>I also work part-time for a research facility at UNL. In late August, 2018, I was hired by a professor and long-time engineer of the Midwest Roadside Saftey Facility to transcribe Russian schematics for road rails from a potential client to English, and later provided live-translation for the professor when the client's representative visited the facility for a few days.</p>
								<p>
								Afterwards, I was hired to be a research assistant to the professor and was almost immediately assigned to update and manage the decade-old facility website to a modern and supported format, one that accurately reflected the high quality of work in crash-testing and barrier safety that the facility represented. </p>
								<p>
								I learned PHP from scratch. I had to learn how to use phpmyadmin and learn SQL. My previous background consisted of Java and minimal work in HTML/CSS and JS, but I've become a much more well-rounded software dev because of this job.</p>
								<p>
								I have worked without a senior dev for the whole time that I've been at MwRSF, my sole programming co-worker being from a different department, who was a truly a blessing for me as I love working in teams rather than on my own. Thankfully, the site is near completion; it'll include a revitalizing look that matches the rest of the University, with features that include a research hub and report database for the clientele of the facility.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">ENTJ | True-Neutral</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was raised at a high standard; my parents taught me to expect nothing, to work hard silently, and to anticipate for negative outcomes. I started to work in agriculture as a 13 year old every summer until I got old enough to work at a supermarket. After finishing High School, I started University and it's been a rough ride. Thankfully, I've held on, am enjoying what I'm learning, have good jobs, and will finish with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity with an assortment of possible minors within the next two years.</p>

								<p>I as a person am reserved yet open professionally. I like to enjoy myself by surrounding myself in music and technology. I love rock and metal, electronic music, as well as classical music; I play the guitar and played the saxophone for almost 9 years.</p>
